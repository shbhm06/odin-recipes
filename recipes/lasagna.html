    <h2>Description</h2>
    Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with fillings such as meat (typically ground beef or sausage), tomato sauce, and béchamel or ricotta cheese. The layers are repeated and topped with cheese, then baked until golden and bubbly. It's a hearty, flavorful, and widely loved comfort food that can also be made vegetarian or with other variations.
